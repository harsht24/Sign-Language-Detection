# Sign-Language-Detection
This project is dedicated to developing a Sign Language Recognition System
(SLRS) that facilitates communication between the deaf and hard-of-hearing
community and the hearing population. By employing advanced artificial intel-
ligence, including a multi-headed convolutional neural network tailored for rec-
ognizing Indian sign language letters , in which the system aims to translate sign
language gestures into written text with high accuracy and reduced latency. We
encountered several challenges, including over-fitting, class imbalance, choosing
a proper dataset, and the complexities of gesture recognition in diverse en-
vironments. Nevertheless, our preliminary results demonstrate promising im-
provements, highlighting the systemâ€™s potential in educational, healthcare, and
communicative contexts. Our ongoing efforts are focused on enhancing the tech-
nical robustness of the system through iterative preprocessing, Incorporating
real time detection using object detection API, and expanding past just In-
dian sign language and using other languages such as American sign language.
This work underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in
creating more inclusive communication tools for society.
